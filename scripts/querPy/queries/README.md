This folder contains sparql query collections for either manual or automated executions by the use of querPy (official git repo: https://github.com/steffres/querPy , and a version of querPy with testing credentials pre-included can be found in the d4science Parthenos Gateway under the path *VRE Folders > PARTHENOS_Registry > querPy with credentials*.

## manual executions:

download a query collection file from a subfolder and run it using the querPy script locally on your machine (as described in the querPy repo).

## automated executions

just place your query collection in the folder 'regular_executions', and therein in another subfolder where its name should indicate its execution intervals (e.g. friday_0500). It will then be run automatically by an instance running on one of the ACDH's servers.

## results

The results can be saved for example in this mutual google driver folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f2-CpoVx3aQ414e2MNsUvFlXEWd1uiu1
