This folder 'queries' shall collect and aggregate SPARQL queries for either manual or automated executions in the context of the Parthenos metadata analysis.

## manual executions:

download the query collection from here and run them using the querPy script locally on your machine.

## automated executions

just place your query collection in the folder 'regular_executions', and therein in another subfolder where its name shall indicate its execution intervals. It will then be run automatically by an instance running on one of the ACDH's servers.

## results

The results can be saved for example in this mutual google driver folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f2-CpoVx3aQ414e2MNsUvFlXEWd1uiu1
