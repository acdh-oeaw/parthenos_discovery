description = "As designed in Parthenos, the origin of a triple is encoded by its respective graph (the fourth part in the quadruple). The graph then again is itself in a relation to its specific provenance (datasets by a provider) as well as its source (the provider). This set of queries produces an overview of how many triples originate from how many provenances and sources."
