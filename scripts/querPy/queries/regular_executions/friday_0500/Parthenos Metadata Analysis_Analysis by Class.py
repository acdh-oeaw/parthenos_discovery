# Notes on syntax of queries-set:
# * the set of queries is enclosed by '[' and ']'
# * individual queries are enclosed by '{' and '},'
# * All elements of a query (title, description, query) need to be defined using quotes as well as their contents, and both need to be separated by ':'
# * All elements of a query (title, description, query) need to be separated from each other using quotes ','
# * The content of a query needs to be defined using triple quotes, e.g. """ SELECT * WHERE .... """
# * Any indentation (tabs or spaces) do not influence the queries-syntax, they are merely syntactic sugar.
