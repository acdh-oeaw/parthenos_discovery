# defines the set of queries to be run.
# MANDATAORY

# Each query is itself encoded as a python dictionary, and together these dictionaries are collected in a python list. 
# Beginner's note on such syntax as follows:
# * the set of queries is enclosed by '[' and ']'
# * individual queries are enclosed by '{' and '},'
# * All elements of a query (title, description, query) need to be defined using quotes as well as their contents, and both need to be separated by ':'
# * All elements of a query (title, description, query) need to be separated from each other using quotes ','
# * The content of a query needs to be defined using triple quotes, e.g. """ SELECT * WHERE .... """
# * Any indentation (tabs or spaces) do not influence the queries-syntax, they are merely syntactic sugar.



# --------------- CUSTOM POST-PROCESSING METHOD --------------- 
'''
The method 'custom_post_processing(results)' is a stump for custom post processing which is always called if present and to which
result data from the query execution is passed. This way you can implement your own post-processing steps there.

The incoming 'results' argument is a list, where each list-element is a dictionary represting all data of a query.

This dictionary has the following keys and respective values:

* most likely to be needed are these two keys and values:
'query_title' - title of an individual query, as defined above.
'results_matrix' - the result data organized as a two dimensional list, where the first row contains the headers. 
This value is what you would most likely need to post process the result data.  

* other than these two, each query dictionary also contains data from and for querPy, which might be of use:
'query_description' - description of an individual query, as defined above.
'query_text' - the sparql query itself.
'results_execution_duration' - the duration it took to run the sparql query.
'results_lines_count' - the number of lines the sparql query produced at the triplestore.
'results_raw' - the result data in the specified format, encapsulated by its respective python class (e.g. a python json object).
'query_for_count' - an infered query from the original query, is used to get number of result lines at the triplestore.

As an example to print the raw data from the second query defined above, write:
print(results[1]['results_matrix'])
